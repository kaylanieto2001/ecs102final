This is my final project for ECS 102. I created a Guess Who game which incorporated the use of classes, graphics, random,
if statements, and numerous functions that call each other. Through this complex code, I was able to demonstrate my understanding
of concepts taught in ECS 102 to the full extent and go above and beyond with this project.
